 ## About me
 I have the ability to work in multitasking mode. My high analytical skills allow me to work effectively with large amount of information.  I have worked a lot with data bases.
 I am  purposeful and ready to bring any business to a fruitful end.
 I conscientiously carry out the assigned tasks and always try to do everything to the promised deadline (I am clearly able to  assess the deadlines for completing the task).
 I am ambitious, I consider that it's necessary to work in order to achieve results, and not stand still.
 I have a desire for professional growth and easy learning.
 I am proactive, I think not only about the ways to solve the problem, but also about how they will affect the project on the whole.
 I am adaptible, I am able to show flexibility in the working process, for example, changes in the team, the transition to a remote work mode, these changing conditions will not affect the result of the work.
